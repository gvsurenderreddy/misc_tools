Logmanage script
---------------

The purpose of this script is to route log messages come from differt devices in lan to log server sysklogd.
Sysklogd is a very minimal log server installed in most embedded systems and it doesn't provide like other version (e.g. syslogd syslog-ng) to filter the from field of the massages to route them in a specific logfile. (with +hostname entry in syslogd.conf).

Usage

1) Identify the specific facility that you want to filter, for example: 
cron, auth and syslog. Setup the script with dafult folder for log files and put the three names in the declared vector
logdir="/var/log/"
fifodir="/var/log/"
# Name of logs
logname=(auth cron syslog)

2) In /etc/syslog.conf 
auth,authpriv.*                 /var/log/auth.fifo
*.*;auth,authpriv,cron.none     /var/log/syslog.fifo
cron.*                          /var/log/cron.fifo

3) In the script startup
/path/logmanager.sh run
/sbin/syslogd -m 0 -r

4) In log directories there are  file like:
syslog-<machineIP>.log, cron-<machineIP>.log and so on .....

5) If you stop the log service, then run logmanager.sh flush

6) Example setup of logrotate:

/var/log/syslog-*.log {                                                                      
        monthly                                                                              
        rotate 4

        create 644 root root
